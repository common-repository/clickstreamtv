== Installation ==

Installation can be done in one of three ways:

1. In the WordPress plugins section, click 'Add New', enter 'clickstreamtv' in the search box, and click 'install' once the plugin appears.
2. Download the plugin from http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/clickstreamtv/.  In the plugins 'Add New' section,  click 'upload', select the file you just downloaded and click 'install. 
3. If the first two options fail, you can still install the plugin manually.  To do so, you will need ftp access and an ftp client.
Once you have these two prerequisites:
- login to your WordPress site via the ftp client
- navigate to /<your WordPress directory>/wp-content/plugins/
- unzip the plugin you downloaded (step 2)
- upload the entire 'clickstreamtv' directory to the 'plugins' directory
- That's it.  You should now have the plugin available in your WordPress admin.

Once installed, activate the plugin, then enter your ClickStreamTV account id and api key (setting page).
